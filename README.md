# work-calendar-app
a  daily planner calendar application 
which should mark time current time, the future and the past by color coding them. Your inputted information should also be saved when the page is refreshed.
this project was built using jquery, and dayjs.
currently only dayjs is working as required, but I am deploying now so I do not get behind on other work.
I am well aware that more work is needed in bug fixing on this application.
below is a screenshot of the deployed site
